## **This is the Lit Review paragraph for the Orientation to College and Freshman year Persistence / Withdrawal Decisions**

This article delves into the study of student persistence and withdrawal in post secondary institutions. This work builds upon Spady, Tinto, and Bean by investigating the effect college orientation has on student persistence until graduation. The factors that go into orientation include administrative regulations and expected behaviors in the institution, introducal to studnet organizations and activities, aquaint them with available student serves, help design an academic program, and provide opportunities to meet informally with faculty outside of the classroom. In general the goal of the orientation is to facilitate the students successful integration into a new and unfamiliar acedemic and social setting. To accomplish this study the authors expanded upon Tintos conceptual model to inlcude orientation experiences between background characteristics and initial commitments in the model. A statistical analysis was run on the data and concluded that students who participated in a two day orientation were more likely to persist through one year of college than a students who did not attend the orientation.
