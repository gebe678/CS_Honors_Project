## **This is the Lit Review paragraph for the Perceived Quality of Academic Advising: The Effect on Freshman Attrition Article**

This paper examins the effect high quality advising has on acedemic performance. The acedemic performance was measured using the students GPA, satisfaction being a student in the instution, how much the education they recieve will effect their future employment oppurtunities, and finially how many of the students want to leave the university. To accomplish this goal this paper uses a model of the attrition process for students that are older than 24, live off campus or are a part time student. Using this model the researchers are able to perdict how well the student is likely to perform or how likely the student is to remain at the college. Using this model the relationship between the advising quality that was given and student attrition is established and studied. The results of this study showed that the biggest contributer to students dropping out was grades. In conclusion, the study found that good advising did not have much of an effect on the number of studnets who dropout, but do have a number of indirect effects which increase the students acedimic performance.
