## **This is the Lit Review paragraph for the FIRST THINGS FIRST: Developing Academic Competence in the First Year of College**

This article examines the multiple forces and settings in which students and organizations operaate that can effect a students learning and development during the students first year in college. To accomplish this the study looked at seven "foundational dimension statments". Each of these statments identifies different features instutions have that are effective in promoting persistence among first year college students. These statments provide the framework that supports the results this paper contains. There were several variables that independently contributed to the persistence of college freshman. Some of these variables include Supporting all students, cognitive engagement, acedemic engagemnt, instutioonal challenge, preparing faculty, diverse interactions, peer enviornmetn, coherent first year, out of class engagement, and faculty development. These variables were alos predictors of future growth and acedemic competence. In summary this paper identifies the seven foundational dimensions that help analyze influences on a students ability to learn measured on the academic competence scale.
