## Meeting Notes for September 16 2021 Honors Research

Add in bibtex files for all of the lit review summaries. Make sure that the unique identifier for the summaries @Book{Knuth97, (after the {) is in the github with the summary and the full bibtex citation is in the file containing all of the summaries. This will ensure that it is easy to cite the papers while writing the full thesis.

### For Next Week:

Go through some more of the bibtex files and play arount with latex. Maybe watch some youtube.
Set up sections in the paper to mirror the thesis file format that exists within the honors thesis guide on Dr. Summets github.

Read more of the literature and write more summaries in the github. Start reading the textbook for the data analysis portion of the coding project.
