1. Password Management in Github
.gitignore - textfile that you want github to ignore/not push to the repo.

There can be two folders the source folder and the restricted file. The .gitignore file should contain the rectricted file and the data file to ignore.

restricted                          src                         data

pw.txt                              program files               file1.csv ...

2. CSV files in python (use the csv module) 
3. play around with encrypted files in python

Focus on numbers 1 and 2 for now and attempt number three if time allows.

4. look into webscraping/webparsing in python, and take the data from the class registration page.
download the page, pick a semester, and try to parse the html into usable data. (create class objects or csv file with the needed data).
