One example that was found to help midigate this is 2-3 hours of additional summer support. This has shown increased enrollment of 3-4% overall and 8% increase in low income students. Another area that helped increase enrollment rates was automized text messaging to help students be aware of required tasks to enroll in college. In conclusion this article summarizes research done to find solutions to help increase attendence rates in college for high school seniors going to college.
