## Meeting Notes

Nov 4 may be late due to apartment meeting

Fall 17 - two tables which are csv files / excel files We should get one for July 15 and one for Sept 17. The data will contain an anomonized student id and a list of crns. Each crn is a class that the stuend has taken. There can be up to seven classes. One table from July is the classses they are automatically registered for and the Sept 17 table is the classes after their first advising session.

Look for RCC classes and classes such as labs (cms 120, 120L) that have dual enrollements and treat them like they are one course. Some of these courses have the labs under one crn and others do not.

We should also have some of the students preferences these things include potiential majors and RCC'S they want. This will come into analysis later on and this can be used to compare to the faculty schedule to see how many of those courses they keep.

RCC
major interest
competency
other 

Should check some of these boxes to use as a measure of "goodness" for the schedule.

May have to treat the major interest as other because the student may not have filled out the course.

Don't worry about the students who do not show up or drop out before the school semester starts.

first check how many classes stay between the two tables.
