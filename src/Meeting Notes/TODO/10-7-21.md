Class schedules for Falls 2017-2021

The data will consists of an 
AID (anomonized id number)
CRNS for the courses (one of these will be an RCC)
We will ignore the RCC courses because they should stay

We are looking at what were they origionally registered for and what did they end up taking.

We will have on efor July 1st when the schedule is assigned and Sept 15 when they get to change their course
First question is how many courses did the students keep from their origional schedules? (regardless of added courses)

Think about data visuliazation look at tableau and some other data visuliazation services.
what classes are they changing? Different sections? Different courses in the same department? Different couses completely?
Very difficult to find out why the students are making these decisisons.
