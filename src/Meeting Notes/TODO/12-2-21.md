# TODO Over Break

1. Add interactivity to the script based on the calculations. What years does the user want to look at? 2017-2021, a range 2017-2018, or a single year such as 2018

add in the year information to the graphs - be careful about the labels on the graph should reflect the acual infomration displayed

2. Look into comparisons (single years)

stat1   data        data        data
