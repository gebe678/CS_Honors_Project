## TODO for 1-24-22

start to write up some of the work that we have accomplished up so far. Use the latex document that we have set up earlier.

Start thinking about creating a 10-15 minute presentation about the results of the code we have created. Create a slidedeck (6-7 slides) add in the graphs to the slidedeck with some extra text to describe what the graphs are representing. Example what do we mean by classes. Someone who is invested in the project but not the software should be able to understand the presentation.

Start the thesis with an introduction. Watch the presentation about how to write a good research paper (link in email from Dr. Summet). He talks about how to write the introduction. Create a story scetch about the introduction for the thesis paper.

Start documententing the software I have written so far. Create UML diagrams and other diagrams for the software.

Priority:

1. Presentation
2. UML Diagrams / introduction thesis work
3. work on resume for next week talk about the Georgia Tech program
